Crazy project to show that we can generate templates in Java for HTML pages that are directly integratable with 
any java code.

This is meant for those projects where the backend developers need to maintain the HTML generation and would like to have 
static typing to help with maintainance.

The code is merley a proof of concept and if you use it in production you should be prepared to maintain it yourself.
On the other hand pull requests are welcome.
